NLP is a specialized area in AI that exclusively deals with processing of Natural language including understanding, generating text such as individual characters, words, paragraphs, documents such as whole of Wikipedia.

# Basic NLP Concepts <a id="concepts"></a>

Language is symbolic and discrete. Both characters and words are discrete symbols. The basic elements of written langugage are characters. Characters form words that in turn denote objects, concepts, events, actions, and ideas. For instance, words such as "hamburger" or "pizza" each evoke in us a certain mental representations, but they are also distinct symbols, whose meaning is external to them and left to be interpreted in our heads.

While in Computer Vision (CV) or Speech Processing, basic building blocks are continuous in nature, allowing, for exanple, to move from a colorful image  to a gray-scale one using a simple mathematical operation, or to compare two different colors based on their inherent properties such as hue and intensity. This can not be done easily with words - *there is no simple operation that will allow us to move from the word "red" to the word "pink" without using a large lookup table or dictionary*.
