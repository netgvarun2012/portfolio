# AI Basics

The training data is assumed to be constant while weights of a Network are said to be variable.

- Machine learning

In Machine learning, your data consists of **Dependent** and **Independent** variables which is also known by other names:

# <ins>Data is of 2 types at High-level</ins>

### If *response* variable is "qualitative - classification" , "quantitative - regression".

Irrespective of whether the **Quantitative response** variable is continuous or discrete, regression method is more applicable. Such as, "number of cars". 

However, if response variable can be categorized into certain range or categories like "low","medium", or "high", then Classification method is more suitable.

### If *predictor* variable is qualitative , then they need to be properly coded before the analysis is performed.
